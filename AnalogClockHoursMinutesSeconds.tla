------------------- MODULE AnalogClockHoursMinutesSeconds -------------------
(*
It seems obvious to me that in any sensible definition of implementation,
a clock that displays hours, minutes, and seconds should implement the
specification of a clock that displays hours and minutes. I realized in 1983
that the simplest way to ensure that this is true is to require that all
specifications allow stuttering stepsï¿½steps in which the state of the system
does not change.

Steps of an hour/minute/second clock in which only the seconds change
implement stuttering steps of the hour/minute clock's specification.
In the decades since then, I have continued to explain this to people.
To my knowledge, no state-based specification formalism other than TLA
has adopted the idea. I suspect that even many TLA+ users think it's weird
to require that specifications allow stuttering steps.
