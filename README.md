# A Clock: Specified and Checked
A simple clock to demonstrate:
1. Model checking with TLA+,
1. Model-based testing with FsCheck, and
1. The analogy between hierarchical TLA+ specifications and model-based testing.

# TODO
- [x] Add a hierarchical TLA+ specification of a simple clock
- [ ] Implement a trivial hours, minutes and seconds clock class in C#
- [ ] Add a model-based test with FsCheck that tests only the hours and minutes
